## Description
In this project, I aim to create a Restaurants List & Review application using Expo, React Native, and Firebase. The app will allow users to browse a list of restaurants, search for specific restaurants, and see top-ranked restaurants based on users' reviews. Additionally, the application will have a register and login system to ensure that only registered users are allowed to leave reviews. Users will also be able to create a favorite list for the restaurants they have visited.

The main technologies and services used in this project will include:
- Expo: A framework and platform for universal React applications.
- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications.
- Firebase: A backend-as-a-service platform that provides authentication, real-time database, and hosting services.

## Installation
To install and run this project on your mobile, follow these steps:

1. Install the Expo Go app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www&pli=1) or [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)
2. Go to https://expo.dev/@expoluisbulltest/5-tenedores?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go

## Usage
Once the project is up and running, you can use the Restaurants List & Review app in the following way:

As an unregistered and unlogged user:

- Use the navigation buttons to move with ease through the app, allowing for intuitive exploration and a seamless user experience.
- Scroll through the list of restaurants to discover various options available.
- Select a restaurant from the list to view detailed information about it, including the location and the stars based on user reviews.
- Explore the top five restaurants based on reviews, which will help you identify the highly recommended ones.

As a registered and logged-in user:
- Edit your login details, such as email, password, and avatar, to keep your information up to date.
- Create restaurants by adding images, location on the map, and a description. This allows you to contribute to the app's content and share information about new and exciting dining options.
- Leave reviews for the restaurants you've visited, sharing your experiences and opinions with the community. Your reviews will help other users make informed decisions and discover great places to dine.
- Create a favorites list to easily keep track of the restaurants you've enjoyed and want to remember. This feature allows you to curate a personalized list of your preferred dining spots.
- By providing these features, the app aims to enhance user engagement and provide a platform for sharing valuable insights and recommendations within the restaurant community.
